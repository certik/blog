# Summary

I started out in organic chemistry and ended up making supercomputers at Intel.

Since people often ask me about how this happened, or to speak about career paths in general, I figure I should write it down.

#  The beginning

I was fascinated by quantum mechanics from a young age, probably because it was elusive, not because I had a particular need for it.  I remember reading books on heavy-element chemistry and string theory in high school, in those books written by popularizers that hide all the math.  This was most useful in chemistry class, mostly because my boredom often led to mischief, and a chemistry lab is a very bad place to conduct mischief (my high school was old and had actual uranium in storage that nobody knew how to dispose of without shutting down the school).

My career plan at that time was to become a lawyer, because I was under the foolish impression that this was a good way to get rich arguing with people.  However, I did really well in chemistry and math classes, so I kept taking them, because they were usually an easy way to get my grades up.  However, it became clear in college that my math skills were more suited for a chemistry major than a math major, which aligned with my disinterest in not learning German, French and/or Russian (as was prescribed for PhDs in math).

I became a chemistry major because of a University of Washington Professor named Nic Epiotis.  Epiotis was a character: he told off-topic stories during lectures and disparaged organic chemistry traditions like "actually reading the textbook" and "memorizing things".  I recall one day he held up a 700-page organic chemistry textbook, pinched off about 20 pages and declared, "if you read and understand this section, you can get an A in this class - the rest of the book doesn't matter."  As an inherently lazy person, this was my kind of class.

Later in my undergraduate years, I was drawn into computational chemistry research thanks to Professors Wes Borden and Bill Reinhardt, along with Eric Brown, who was a rather charismatic T.A. and my research mentor in Wes' group.  Eric filled me with all sorts of ideas, essentially all of which have turned out to be useful.  Eric discouraged me from taking any classes in computer science because, "why do you want to learn Java?" and encouraged me to go deep into the theoretical and computational aspects of chemistry, which I did in grad school.  At the time, I was proficient in running Gaussian, and dabbled in Mathematica and Matlab, but I couldn't have compiled a C or Fortran program if my life depended on it.

I went to the University of Chicago for grad school because (1) the quality of the faculty, (2) its reputation as an intensely academic place, and (3) the cost-of-living was a lot lower than at Berkeley, which matters when you're going to make $20K/year.  The first half of grad school was devoted to intensely theoretical topics with rudamentary computation, primarily done in Matlab.
