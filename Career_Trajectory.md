# Summary

I started out in organic chemistry and ended up making supercomputers at Intel.

Since people often ask me about how this happened, or to speak about career paths in general, I figure I should write it down.

#  The beginning

I was fascinated by quantum mechanics from a young age, probably because it was elusive, not because I had a particular need for it.  I remember reading books on heavy-element chemistry and string theory in high school, in those books written by popularizers that hide all the math.  This was most useful in chemistry class, mostly because my boredom often led to mischief, and a chemistry lab is a very bad place to conduct mischief (my high school was old and had actual uranium in storage that nobody knew how to dispose of without shutting down the school).

My career plan at that time was to become a lawyer, because I was under the foolish impression that this was a good way to get rich arguing with people.  However, I did really well in chemistry and math classes, so I kept taking them, because they were usually an easy way to get my grades up.  However, it became clear in college that my math skills were more suited for a chemistry major than a math major, which aligned with my disinterest in not learning German, French and/or Russian (as was prescribed for PhDs in math).

I became a chemistry major because of a University of Washington Professor named Nic Epiotis.  Epiotis was a character: he told off-topic stories during lectures and disparaged organic chemistry traditions like "actually reading the textbook" and "memorizing things".  I recall one day he held up a 700-page organic chemistry textbook, pinched off about 20 pages and declared, "if you read and understand this section, you can get an A in this class - the rest of the book doesn't matter."  As an inherently lazy person, this was my kind of class.

Later in my undergraduate years, I was drawn into computational chemistry research thanks to Professors Wes Borden and Bill Reinhardt, along with Eric Brown, who was a rather charismatic T.A. and my research mentor in Wes' group.  Eric filled me with all sorts of ideas, essentially all of which have turned out to be useful.  Eric discouraged me from taking any classes in computer science because, "why do you want to learn Java?" and encouraged me to go deep into the theoretical and computational aspects of chemistry, which I did in grad school.  At the time, I was proficient in running Gaussian, and dabbled in Mathematica and Matlab, but I couldn't have compiled a C or Fortran program if my life depended on it.

I went to the University of Chicago for grad school because (1) the quality of the faculty, (2) its reputation as an intensely academic place, and (3) the cost-of-living was a lot lower than at Berkeley, which matters when you're going to make $20K/year.  The first half of grad school was devoted to intensely theoretical topics with rudamentary computation, primarily done in Matlab.

In my first year of grad school, I applied to fellowships, including the Department of Energy (DOE) Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (henceforth "CSGF").  Applying for this fellowship requires non-trivial essays about computational science, which prompted me to think a lot about big computers and software in ways that I hadn't before.  Unfortunately, I did not get the fellowship the first time I applied.  Fortunately, in those days, it was possible to apply as a second-year grad student, which I did successfully.  At the time, I was only a Matlab programmer (and a bad one at that), but I had dreams of running semidefinite programming algorithms on Blue Gene/L, which I assume appealed to the selection committee more than my grades.

One of the novel features of the CSGF is that it requires the student to do a "practicum" (internship) at a DOE lab.  I focused on Argonne National Lab (Argonne) and Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL), for both technical and geographic reasons.  I ended up at PNNL working on NWChem because they didn't care that I had no relevant programming experience.  As some of the details of my practicum are found in [Deixis](https://www.krellinst.org/doecsgf/docs/deixis/deixis2007.pdf), I won't repeat them here.

Working at PNNL in the summer of 2006 changed my life and is the reason I've been able to have a career in computing.  Tim Carlson patiently taught me how to administer a Linux system, Jochen Autschbach and Bert de Jong got me started with Fortran (e.g. "start typing at column seven"), Dunyou Wang taught me about version control and regression testing, and Karol Kowalski taught me quantum many-body theory and putting everything together in NWChem.  Karol became my research supervisor and we've written about a dozen papers together by now, which was an abnormally good outcome for a summer internship.

I worked on NWChem full-time for my last three years of grad school and my [dissertation](https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/Coupled_cluster_response_theory_parallel_algorithms_and_novel_applications/967859) is based on that work.  During that time, I became a lot better at programming, although still primary in [old-school Fortran](https://stevelionel.com/drfortran/2020/05/16/doctor-fortran-in-military-strength/), and I learned a lot of peripheral stuff like
